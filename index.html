        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          I am an aspiring web developer who is highly intrested in learning,
          understanding and building. I have done a myriad of different jobs
          throughout my life. Most of them were in the restuarnt industry but I
          learned a great deal about myself though that and I know I can apply
          the same hard work ethic I have to web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          The web is vast and there is so much to know but I am excited and
          ready keep an open mind to learn and contribute to the web community.
